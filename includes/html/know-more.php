<!-- 	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why pay this request fee?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Members have the right to accept or reject the request. We check with them and accordingly schedule, coordinate and gather feedback.</p></li> 
		<li><p>The fee you pay is simply a request fee and not an assurance for the meeting. </p></li>
		<li><p>The request fee is non-refundable. Repeated rejections by the members will affect their ranking, eventually leading them to be taken off from the Snug App.</p></li>
	</ul> -->
		<h2 style="text-align: center;">What happens next?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Once you click confirm, we send your request for a meet to the other member. </p></li>
	<li><p>Your profile link is sent to the other member. No other personal information is shared ever with anyone else. </p></li>
	<li><p>We schedule your meet with the other member either in the cafe video call at a time suitable to both of you. </p></li>
	<li><p>For an online meeting, either a Google meet or a Zoom  room link is shared. Both of you are required to login at the scheduled time.</p></li> 

	<li><p>You spend time with the member when you both meet. Generally these meets last from 30-60 minutes.</p></li> 
	<li><p>Then, both of you rate each other for ensuring only high quality meetings on the Snug app.</p></li> 
	</ul>
